# Message Board
Distributed Systems Assignment #1
---
Introduction:
The two java files "Server.java" and "Client.java" work together to form a message board service where users can create their own message boards and chat to other users on the same message boards in real time.

Instructions:
Extract zip files to a know location on your computer. To run the application use the following commands in your terminal where the files are stored:
1. javac server.java
2. javac client.java
3. java server.java
4. java client.java

Notes:
The server.java file will automatically create a socket on port 1234. 
If this port is already being used please change the number on line 26 of the server.java file. 
As well as change the port you are connecting to in the client.java file by changing the number on line 10.
